- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I thought that it was very clever because comp sci majors hate coding things more than once, so it actually made my job so much easier

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I'm actually really proud of how quickly I completed this assignment. I would definitely recommend looking at the examples and questioning why certain choices were made in the wording. Step away if it gets too difficult
